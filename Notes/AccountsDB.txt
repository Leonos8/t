endUsers(UID, Username, Password, email, phone, active, last accessed, Seller)

UID (account serial number, could be incremental based on when the 
account was created, could be first char of username, underscore, 
serial number (or incremental), or could be randomized series of numbers)
This is an option for if we anonymize users, or want to choose our own
id to keep track of, but its unneccessary

Username=uname

Password=psw

Email=eml

Phone=phone;

active (boolean that identifies whether the account has been deactivated 
or not. Its good practice for records to instead of delete the account, 
just to use a boolean to state that the account has been deactivated, 
this canalso be used when changing information, deactivate the account 
with old information and create a new one with the new information 
(and transfer over any information)

Last accessed (We can store the last time the account was logged into)
